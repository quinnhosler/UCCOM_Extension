#UCCOM Extension

###This will make your computer life at UCCOM much easier. Features include keyboard shortcuts and 0.1x increments for Echo360, personal and class averages for MedOneStop, and will label all those pesky ribbons on LCMS+.

This extension provides simple keyboard shortcuts for the current Echo360 video player. The shortcuts are modeled after Youtube's and are listed in the extension popup.

This extension was created quickly and was meant as a personal extension; however all are welcome to use it. A copy of the source code can be found on the website.
